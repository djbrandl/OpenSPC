  "title": "Plant-Scoped Characteristic Hierarchy and Configuration",
  "current_scope": "Characteristics and configuration are global across the system",
  "proposed_change": "Isolate characteristic hierarchy and configuration per plant. All screens should be scoped to the selected plant. Add per-site settings for data connectivity (MQTT/OPC-UA).",
  "reason": "Enterprise deployments require multi-plant support where each plant has its own characteristic hierarchy, configuration settings, and data connectivity requirements.",
  "requirements": [
    "Characteristic hierarchy isolated per plant",
    "Configuration screens scoped to selected plant",
    "Plant-specific data connectivity settings (MQTT broker, OPC-UA server)",
    "Plant selector filters all data views to selected plant",
    "Plant-level settings page for connectivity configuration"
  ],
  "impact": {
    "timeline": "Significant - requires database schema changes and API refactoring",
    "resources": "Backend + Frontend coordination required",
